Canari's documentation
====================

What is Canari?
---------------

Canari is an open-source library for online change point detection in univariate time series. 
It has been developed in the context of long-term online monitoring where we aim for the early 
detection of subtle change points in the baseline response, while limiting to a minimum the 
number of false alarms.

Because Canari's probabilistic change-point detection relies on 1-step ahead predictions, 
it is inherently capable of performing short- and long-term forecasting, as well as online 
data imputation. One-step ahead predictions can either rely solely on a target time series, 
or on explanatory time series that can be non-linearly related to the target.

In addition to change-point detection and forecasting capabilities, it returns an interpretable 
decomposition of time series into baseline components representing the irreversible responses, 
recurrent pattern components caused by external effects, and residual components allowing the 
characterization of both the model prediction and the observation uncertainties.

How does it work?

The methodological core behind the Canari library consists of a seamless integration between 
`state-space models (SSM) <http://profs.polymtl.ca/jagoulet/Site/PMLCE/CH12.html>`_ and Bayesian 
neural networks. On the one hand, the Gaussian SSM theory enables modelling baseline responses and 
residuals, while on the other, `Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference (TAGI) <https://github.com/lhnguyen102/cuTAGI/tree/main>`_ 
enables treating all parameters and hidden states in neural networks as Gaussians.

Canari uses LSTM neural networks to model recurrent patterns as well as non-linear dependencies 
with respect to explanatory variables. Because both the SSM and LSTM rely on the same Gaussian 
conditional inference mechanism, their hidden states can be inferred analytically in a unified 
probabilistic framework.

The figure on the right presents an example where the raw data in red is decomposed into a baseline that 
is characterized by a baseline “level” component where its rate of change is described by the “trend.” 
The recurrent pattern is modelled by an LSTM Bayesian neural network where the training and validation 
set consists only of 4 years of data. The residual characterizing the model errors is itself modelled 
by a white “noise” component.

Change point detection can be performed either online or offline after the training and validation 
period. The presence of change points is indicated by the probability of regime switches that rise 
toward 1 on several occasions.
